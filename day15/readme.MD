# Day 15
Very much feeling my lack of a CS degree today. I know that I should implement something like Dijkstra, but am having a little trouble getting there. Having a $dayJob is tough because I don't have a lot of time to work through this.

Spent a lot of time working through this. Looked at some other code to see what others did and came up with something janky but workable.
