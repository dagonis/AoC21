# Day 9
This is the first day that I thought I might not finish. I did some reading to figure out ways to approach this can came across the flood fill algorithm. I made some mistakes with clobbering names in my flood fill part that was giving me strange, non-obvious issues.

Glad I stuck with it, but it beat me up.
