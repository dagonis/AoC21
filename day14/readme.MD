# Day 14
Had trouble sleeping so I stayed up for this one. I was happy to see it wasn't another 2d matrix problem. The first half took me a bit and I tried to keep the string together. The second part was a test of performance and my code got to 14 out of 40 iterations before it just stopped working.

I realized the order isn't important, so I used a counter to 'split' each molecule into two and keep track of the counts.

Was getting an incorrect count went testing and realized that the last chara in the original polymer chain wasn't getting counted. 

This was fun, and though the first approach wasn't great I am glad I essentially had to write two solutions for this.

Good night.
