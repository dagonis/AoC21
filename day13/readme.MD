# Day 13
Today was a lot of fun. I was a little shook after how much I struggled yesterday, but today I was able to sit down and spend some quiet time thinking about my approach. I accidentally solved the second part first, only to realize I had gotten ahead of myself. 

I golfed up the code a bit today for fun. Went through and optimized a couple things as well.

Looking forward to tomorrow.
